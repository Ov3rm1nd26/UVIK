## Task 1
For the first task, you just need to run solution.py in the task1 folder

## Task 2
For the second task, you need to run solution.py in the task2 folder
in my case in pycharm I choose terminal

To see all commands use:
```python solution.py --help```

To add an item (task), use: 
```python solution.py add --items 'task'```

To add items (tasks), use: 
```python solution.py add --items 'task1' --items 'task2'```

To remove the first element (task), use: 
```python solution.py remove --positions 1```

To remove the first and third elements (tasks), use: 
```python solution.py remove --positions 1 --positions 3```

To mark the second element (task) as completed, use: 
```python solution.py mark 2```

In order to show the entire list of elements (tasks), use: 
```python solution.py show```

>note that when you call 'show' it shows statistics - how many tasks have been completed
